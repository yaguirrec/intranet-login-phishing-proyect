## Installation and Development Guide

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. Recommended version: **>= 16.x**.
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js. Recommended version: **>= 8.x**.
  - You can check your versions with:
    ```
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

### Installing Dependencies

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

- To start the development server, use:

  ```
  npm run dev
  ```

  or, if your project uses a different script name (e.g., `start` or `serve`), use:

  ```
  npm start
  ```

  or

  ```
  npm run serve
  ```

- The development server will typically be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or another port specified in your project configuration.

### Additional Notes

- If you encounter issues, ensure your Node.js and npm versions meet the recommended requirements.
- For global dependencies or specific tools (like `nodemon`, `vite`, or `next`), refer to the project's README or documentation.
